### **Abstract**

We propose Optical Bead Quantum Computing (OBQC), a novel computational paradigm that exploits multiple degrees of freedom of light to achieve multi-valued information processing in a single photon. Inspired by the visual pattern recognition employed in abacus calculation, OBQC treats discrete photonic states as “beads” that encode 100-10,000 distinguishable values per photon, contrasting with conventional binary (qubit) approaches. We demonstrate that by simultaneously utilizing wavelength, polarization, phase, and temporal structure, a practical implementation with 12×4×6×4 = 1,152 states per photon is feasible with current photonic technology. This work establishes the theoretical foundation, architectural design, and implementation pathway for OBQC, positioning it as a bridge between classical multi-valued logic and quantum computation.

### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1 Motivation**

The dominance of binary logic in modern computing stems from historical constraints of electronic transistors, which naturally exhibit two stable states (on/off). However, light—the carrier of information in photonic systems—possesses multiple independent physical degrees of freedom that remain largely unexploited in conventional optical computing architectures.

Recent advances in optical semiconductor memory (e.g., NTT’s photonic memory [1]) suggest that photonic processing units (optical CPUs/GPUs) are technologically feasible. Yet, if such devices merely replicate binary logic, they fail to leverage the full potential of light’s multi-dimensional state space.

#### **1.2 Conceptual Foundation**

The key insight underlying OBQC emerges from an unexpected source: the Japanese abacus (soroban). Expert abacus users perform rapid mental calculation not through symbolic manipulation, but through visual pattern recognition—treating numbers as spatial configurations of beads rather than abstract symbols [2]. Neuroscience confirms that this process engages the visual cortex’s parallel processing capabilities rather than the language-based sequential processing typical of arithmetic [3].

We propose extending this principle to photonic computation: treating the multi-dimensional state of a photon as a “bead” in a high-dimensional discrete space, where computation becomes pattern transformation rather than numerical operation.

#### **1.3 Contributions**

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. **Theoretical framework**: Formalization of OBQC as a multi-valued photonic computational model
1. **Architectural design**: Specification of a 1,152-state single-photon processor
1. **Implementation pathway**: Staged development plan from 6-state to 1,152-state systems
1. **Comparative analysis**: Performance comparison with binary and quantum approaches
1. **Open invention declaration**: Release of concept as public domain for global collaboration

### **2. Theoretical Framework**

#### **2.1 Photonic Degrees of Freedom**

A single photon possesses multiple independent physical properties that can encode information:

```
Wavelength (λ): Continuous spectrum, discretizable to N_λ values
Polarization (P): 2D state space, discretizable to N_P values  
Phase (φ): Circular parameter [0, 2π), discretizable to N_φ values
Temporal structure (τ): Pulse width/shape, discretizable to N_τ values
```

The total number of distinguishable states is:

**N_total = N_λ × N_P × N_φ × N_τ**

#### **2.2 Realistic State Count**

Based on current photonic technology:

|Degree of Freedom|Practical Range     |Proposed Discretization      |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
|Wavelength       |380-780 nm (visible)|12 discrete wavelengths      |
|Polarization     |0-180°              |4 states (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°)|
|Phase            |0-2π                |6 states (60° intervals)     |
|Pulse width      |ps-ns scale         |4 discrete widths            |

**Total: 12 × 4 × 6 × 4 = 1,152 states per photon**

This represents a **10.17-bit** information capacity per photon, compared to 1 bit for conventional binary photonics.

#### **2.3 Comparison with Quantum Qubits**

A quantum qubit exists in a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩. While measurement yields binary outcomes, the quantum state space is continuous (the Bloch sphere).

OBQC differs fundamentally:

|Property        |Quantum Qubit            |OBQC Photonic Bead         |
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
|State space     |Continuous (Bloch sphere)|Discrete (1,152 points)    |
|Measurement     |Probabilistic collapse   |Deterministic readout      |
|Decoherence     |High sensitivity         |Moderate (classical noise) |
|Error correction|Complex (surface codes)  |Simpler (redundancy coding)|
|Implementation  |Cryogenic (often)        |Room temperature           |

OBQC occupies a middle ground: more states than binary, but deterministic unlike quantum.

### **3. Architecture**

#### **3.1 Single Photon Encoder**

```
Input: Numerical value v ∈ [0, 1151]

Encoding process:
  c = v mod 12           // Color index
  v = v ÷ 12
  p = v mod 4            // Polarization index  
  v = v ÷ 4
  φ = v mod 6            // Phase index
  τ = v ÷ 6              // Pulse width index

Physical implementation:
  - Wavelength: Tunable laser or LED array (12 wavelengths)
  - Polarization: Liquid crystal polarization rotator (4 angles)
  - Phase: Electro-optic phase shifter (6 values)
  - Pulse: Electronic pulse generator (4 widths)
```

#### **3.2 Single Photon Decoder**

```
Physical measurement:
  - Spectrometer → wavelength λ_measured
  - Polarization analyzer → angle P_measured
  - Interferometer → phase φ_measured  
  - Fast photodetector → pulse width τ_measured

Discretization:
  c = argmin_i |λ_i - λ_measured|
  p = argmin_i |P_i - P_measured|
  φ = argmin_i |φ_i - φ_measured|
  τ = argmin_i |τ_i - τ_measured|

Value reconstruction:
  v = τ × 6 × 4 × 12 + φ × 4 × 12 + p × 12 + c
```

#### **3.3 Honeycomb Lattice Processor**

Inspired by hexagonal packing in nature (honeycombs, graphene), we propose a honeycomb lattice arrangement of photonic bead processors:

```
        (A)
       /   \
     (B)   (C)
       \   /
        (D)

Each node: Single-photon bead processor (1,152 states)
Edges: Optical waveguides for photon routing
Nearest-neighbor coupling: Optical interference for joint operations
```

**Advantages**:

- Maximum packing density with uniform connectivity
- Natural support for parallel operations
- Fault tolerance through redundancy
- Scalable architecture (tile arbitrarily)

#### **3.4 Pattern-Based Operations**

Unlike binary logic gates (AND, OR, NOT), OBQC employs pattern transformations:

**Multi-valued AND (minimum)**:

```
AND_OBQC(v1, v2) = min(v1, v2)
Optical implementation: Absorptive filter selecting weaker signal
```

**Multi-valued OR (maximum)**:

```
OR_OBQC(v1, v2) = max(v1, v2)  
Optical implementation: Amplification and thresholding
```

**Multi-valued NOT (complement)**:

```
NOT_OBQC(v) = (N_max - 1) - v
Optical implementation: Wavelength inversion, polarization rotation
```

**Addition (with carry)**:

```
ADD_OBQC(v1, v2) = (v1 + v2) mod N_max, carry = (v1 + v2) ÷ N_max
Optical implementation: Nonlinear optical mixing
```

### **10. Conclusion**

We have introduced Optical Bead Quantum Computing (OBQC), a paradigm that synthesizes insights from traditional abacus calculation, modern photonics, and quantum information theory. By treating photons as multi-valued “beads” in a discrete high-dimensional space, OBQC achieves 10× information density over binary photonics while maintaining deterministic operation and room-temperature feasibility.

The staged implementation pathway—from 6-state proof-of-concept to 1,152-state integrated processors—demonstrates a clear route to practical realization within the next decade. Applications in neural network acceleration, pattern recognition, and cryptography promise significant real-world impact.

**Most importantly**, we release this concept as an open invention, inviting global collaboration to refine, implement, and extend OBQC. The future of computing need not be binary.
